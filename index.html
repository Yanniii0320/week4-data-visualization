        <p>here are some data that colleted from Wikipedia</p>
        <p>The MBTI is based on the influential theory of psychological types proposed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung in 1921, who had speculated that people experience the world using four principal psychological functions—sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking—and that one of these four functions is dominant for a person most of the time. The four categories are introversion/extraversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, judging perceiving. According to the MBTI, each person is said to have one preferred quality from each category, producing 16 unique types.
          The MBTI emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences.The underlying assumption of the MBTI is that we all have specific preferences in the way we construe our experiences, and these preferences underpin our interests, needs, values, and motivation."
          The MBTI Manual states that the indicator "is designed to implement a theory; therefore, the theory must be understood to understand the MBTI". Fundamental to the MBTI is the hypothesis of psychological types as originally developed by Carl Jung. Jung proposed the existence of two dichotomous pairs of cognitive functions:
          The "rational" (judging) functions: thinking and feeling.
          The "irrational" (perceiving) functions: sensation and intuition.
          Jung believed that for every person, each of the functions is expressed primarily in either an introverted or extraverted form. Based on Jung's original concepts, Briggs and Myers developed their own theory of psychological type, described below, on which the MBTI is based.
